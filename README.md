## Summary
In this project, I analyzed real data from Google, Facebook, and Snap, Inc. on the spending and origins of political advertisements on their platform. I used Tableau to aggregate and visualize certain data points, such as money spent on ads or what demographics they attempted to target. These companies provide this political ad data publicly for the sake of increasing their transparency in advertising, although it is important to note that this data is still only what they choose to provide. Facebook’s dataset, while large, even includes clarification that it is only a “snapshot” of what data they actually collect for themselves.

## Data Processing
All data was handled with Python before analysis, specifically the very useful *pandas* library, which allowed me to easily remove the rows and columns I needed from the expansive datasets. An obstacle to accuracy was that pages that were unofficial but affiliated to campaigns could be listed on the data sheets if they had taken out ads, making the task of organization more difficult than simply searching for any ads taken out to endorse a certain candidate. In order to maintain consistency across these datasets, I made sure that where possible, I would only examine pages/advertisers that directly represented or were directly linked to official campaign committees. This meant that in every data sheet, official committee names had to be meticulously picked out of a sometimes-vast array of different possible affiliates. 

For the sake of legibility, I also merged all possible statistics that originated from the same campaign committees, even if they used different pages to push them (for example, the verified Mike Pence page on Facebook was the origin point for a good amount of ads for Donald Trump, but as the organization in charge was “DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT, INC.”, any statistics from that page were added into the total for that organization). 

## Methodology and Analysis
After filtering out information irrelevant to American presidential candidates, the next important issue was how to examine the available statistics. The easiest information to acquire across all three sources was: how much did candidates spend on advertisements, and how many ads did each take out? This became the first data explored. Relatively little money was spent on Snapchat vs Facebook and Google- while it does have a little less than half of the user base of Facebook (approximately 80 million to Facebook’s 220+ million), the attention paid to it by candidates is not nearly proportionate to that. The candidate who took out the most ads on it, Elizabeth Warren, took out only 159 ads on Snapchat over the examined time period, as opposed to tens of thousands of ads placed on each of the other platforms. The fleeting duration of Snapchat’s communication is the probable cause of this, as the app is by nature focused on short and quick messages, leaving little time to attempt much persuasion in the span of less than 10 seconds. It is also interesting to note that only Democratic candidates took out ads on Snapchat, which is likely related to the relatively young age of its userbase. Despite these limitations, though, ads on Snapchat were still powerful, often gathering tens to hundreds of thousands of impressions (views from users) per advertisement, even millions. In particular, advertisements by Mike Bloomberg, which were probably pushed the hardest out of all candidates due to his financial resources, received a total of almost 300 million impressions on Snapchat over the course of his campaign. Here are some visualizations demonstrating this disparity:

Another obstacle in exploring statistics was the difference in their approaches. For example, while Snapchat lists an exact number of impressions received by each individual advertisement on the platform, Google groups them into much wider ranges (≤ 10k, 10k–100k, 100k–1M, 1M–10M, and > 10M impressions), and does not list a clear total number of impressions an advertiser has gathered. Facebook does not provide data about ad impressions at all, period. Directly comparing the numbers of each platform was difficult as a result; other than simply visualizing the available information for Google and Snapchat, not much else could be deduced because of this disparity. Some tactics one could spot from the data included taking out large amounts of relatively cheaper ads rather than lavishing money on a particular advertisement, visible in candidates with smaller spending footprints but significant amounts of ads to their name.

The specificity of Google’s location targeting data wildly varied- targeted areas would be presented as state names, city names, congressional district names, or large collections of zip codes within a state- all within the same “Region” column within the table, or even sometimes through multiple values at the same time. Although much less geographic targeting was present in Snapchat ads in general, its data was similar, including multiple states per column cell in a varying way that made it difficult to pick out each individual advertisement’s geographic push. Given the slightly limited time frame of this project, manually picking out each piece of information made further analysis difficult, although I did my best to clean the data. I was able to extract some general geographic insights from Google's datasets, specifically which states (and congressional districts) had the most money spent on them by way of geographically targeted advertisements. California and Texas unsurprisingly yielded the most total amount of money as states, to be expected given their massive size and population. Florida, a populous and highly contentious "swing state", also showed large amounts of money invested in ads. Here is one map showing how much money in USD was spent

However, breaking this down further, the single congressional district that was spent on the most was Iowa’s IA-3 district; in fact, enough money was spent on each of Iowa’s congressional districts to rival some entire states. This thoroughly demonstrates Iowa’s power not only as a swing state, but also as the site of the Iowa caucuses, the first step of the presidential primary election- and one of the most closely focused-on as a result. The following chart shows the spread of costs spent on political ads on Google, via congressional district rather than via state:

## Conclusion
Looking at the advertising activities across all of these presidential campaigns, it is clear that sheer brute force via finances/numbers is not a tactic that can support a campaign. This is evidenced in large part by Mike Bloomberg’s presidential run. The campaign dispersed a huge amount of advertisements (which in turn garnered an extremely large amount of collective views) in a short amount of time versus the other Democratic candidates, and was even able to hold a candle to the incumbent President Trump’s total amount of ads in terms of sheer number of advertisements on Facebook and other platforms. However, despite his heavy push of his own campaign financially, and the numbers that show that it indeed did reach far and wide across the US, that message did not stick, as he dropped out of the race one week before the submission of the project's report. It shows the appeal of a candidate cannot strictly be quantified with such numbers, even when they are tied to something as closely human-linked as social networks. 

To exapnd on this, a huge reach doesn’t necessarily mean that all the individuals reached will become a meaningful core supporter of a cause. It is also intriguing how demographic-specific targeting is relatively underused in these advertisements compared to what one might expect, or even ineffective. For example, despite what seems to be a thoughtful approach to advertisement investment overall, even making use of particularly niche demographics, none of the Democratic campaigns mentioned in this report have lasted until the present day except for Bernie Sanders, who had arguably the smallest investment in advertisement among all the other candidates of his party. This is perhaps a reflection of how much more effective in-person communication is for political points; while video or photo advertisements can get simpler messages across, there is nothing like a properly done event and speech (and the subsequent word of mouth) to convincingly convey nuanced ideas and plans to particular demographics. The work in this project is missing such a human aspect, using only quantitative data, and combining this vein of exploration with sentiment analysis or other sorts of research could have interesting results in the future.
